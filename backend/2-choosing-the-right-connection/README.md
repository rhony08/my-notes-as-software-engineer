# Choosing the Right Connection: Navigating Between RPC, REST, and Event-Driven Architectures

As a software engineer in this era, the choice of connection architecture plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency, scalability, and performance of your service. Three prominent options are Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Representational State Transfer (REST), and event-driven architectures. Each of these connections has its own set of advantages, disadvantages, and specific use cases within the context of an application. In this article, we'll dive into the nuances of these architectures and explore how they can be leveraged for your service.

## Understanding RPC, REST, and Event-Driven Architectures
### RPC (Remote Procedure Call):
RPC is a communication protocol that allows one program to request a service or procedure from another program located on a remote machine. It enables seamless interaction between distributed components, making it appear as if the procedure is executed locally.

### REST (Representational State Transfer):
REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses a stateless, client-server model where resources are identified by URIs, and interactions are performed through standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Event-Driven Architecture:
An event-driven architecture is centered around the concept of events and messages. Components or services communicate by emitting and subscribing to events, allowing for loose coupling and asynchronous communication.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
### RPC:

#### Advantages:
- Low-latency communication due to direct method invocation.
- Strongly typed interfaces enhance compile-time checks.
- Suitable for scenarios requiring precise control over communication flow.

#### Disadvantages:

- Tightly coupled components can lead to dependencies.
- Scalability might be challenging due to synchronous communication.
- Limited language and platform interoperability.


### REST:
#### Advantages:

- Simplicity in design and ease of understanding.
- Platform-independent due to reliance on standard HTTP methods.
- Scalability can be achieved through caching and load balancing.

#### Disadvantages:
- Overhead of HTTP headers and statelessness can impact performance.
- Limited support for real-time communication.
- Complex APIs might require multiple requests for a single action.


### Event-Driven:
#### Advantages:
- Loose coupling enables independent services and components.
- Efficient for real-time updates and handling asynchronous workflows.
- Scalability is inherently supported through message brokers.

#### Disadvantages:
- More complex to implement due to asynchronous nature.
- Eventual consistency might require careful handling.
- Debugging can be challenging due to non-linear event flows.


## Reasons to Pick Each Connection
### Choosing RPC:

We can adopt RPC for internal connections, which offers swifter performance compared to REST, and adds an extra layer of security through the requirement of a proto file for service access.

For example, in scenarios where we must validate tokens from client-executed APIs, such as those directed at the User Service, RPC provides a quicker validation process. By leveraging RPC, we can ensure faster token validation. Therefore, in cases where data is required from other services within a microservice architecture, RPC is an optimal choice, especially if your programming language provides support for it.


### Choosing REST:

REST proves highly beneficial for our gateway, enabling client accessibility through REST. This ensures client interaction while also catering to simplicity and accessibility. The simplicity of RESTful API design further streamlines the retrieval of vital information.

Moreover, REST can serve as the ideal choice when we require interaction with services that operate in programming languages without RPC support. The versatility of RESTful architecture makes it adaptable across various scenarios, extending its utility beyond just client interactions.

In summary, REST remains a versatile and effective option, offering accessibility to clients, simplicity in API design, and compatibility with a diverse range of service interactions.

### Choosing Event-Driven:

Event-Driven architecture proves advantageous in scenarios where asynchronous processing is required and the execution is needed in another service. This architecture is particularly suitable for transactions or processes that can proceed in the background even after the original context has concluded or been canceled. Typically, a dedicated consumer service handles data published using this approach.

Additionally, Event-Driven architecture finds utility in real-time data scenarios. By employing a message broker that supports event-streaming, updates to data can be promptly reflected. Consequently, this allows seamless access to real-time data updates whenever new data is published.

In essence, Event-Driven architecture excels in situations demanding asynchronous processing, background execution, and real-time data updates, offering enhanced flexibility and responsiveness.

Example: Event-driven architecture is suitable for sending notifications. When a user receives funds or completes a transaction, an event can be published to notify other services or users. This enables real-time notifications without tightly coupling services.


## Conclusion
The choice between RPC, REST, and event-driven architectures for your application depends on your specific requirements, including latency, scalability, and real-time interactions. Each architecture offers distinct advantages and disadvantages that align with different aspects of your application functionality. By carefully considering your application's needs and understanding the strengths of each architecture, you can architect a resilient and performant your service.

The choice of connection architecture has far-reaching implications on user experience, responsiveness, and overall system reliability. Whether you prioritize immediate balance updates, seamless account queries, or real-time notifications, the right connection architecture will be a cornerstone of your success.
