Hi everyone, I am Rhony, currently working as Software Engineer. I will use this note to share with you all things that I know from my experience.

## Find a mistake? Or want to contribute?
Since I made this all by my experience, there is a chance the content isnt valid or maybe you have other way to describe or things to add, feel free to PR to this repo.

## How to contribute
To kickstart the process, create a new folder for each specific area you plan to cover. If a folder doesn't exist for your topic, feel free to create one. For instance, you can use a "backend" folder if your article is focused solely on backend topics, or a "general" folder if your article is relevant to multiple roles.

Inside each folder, add a README.md file, which will serve as the primary document for your content. To ensure clarity and ease of navigation, consider numbering the folders sequentially. For example, use a naming convention like "1-sql-vs-no-sql" to help readers easily follow the intended order of your content.

By adopting this straightforward organization, your repository will be well-structured, enabling others to access your content effortlessly. Now, you're all set to embark on your writing and sharing journey! Happy writing and sharing your knowledge with the community!


That's all from me. Enjoy!!
