Hi everyone, I am Rhony, currently working as Software Engineer. I will use this note to share with you all things that I know from my experience.

# Find a mistake? Or want to contribute?
Since I made this all by my experience, there is a chance the content isnt valid or maybe you have other way to describe or things to add, feel free to PR to this repo.

That's all from me. Enjoy!!
